## Spring 2021 Web Development Challenge - Programmer Blog

This is the fourth project in my [Spring 2021 - Web Development Challenge](https://10in30.alexander-morse.com/) series, where I am attempting to design, code, and ship ten different web projects in the space of one month, under a variety of constraints.

This project was a simple proof-of-concept blog built using Jekyll.

A live version of this project can be found running [here](https://arm-ac-coder-blog.surge.sh/).

## Blog Post

**Start Date**: April 9, 2021

**End Date**: April 10, 2021

I’m *trying* not to be too bitter about the last project. As a distraction, let’s do a CSS-oriented one next.

This is a proof-of-concept, programmer’s blog made using the Jekyll static site generator. Despite this being my first time using it, Jekyll is nothing if not user-friendly, and it did 99% of what I wanted out of the box, leaving most of my time free to write the custom CSS. Beyond that, I didn’t dive too deeply into the system beyond basic functionality, but the documentation suggests that extending it further wouldn’t have taken more than a few lines of code if I’d needed to.

I was also quite happy with how quickly I was able to create a functional website. If I needed an SSG for something outside of this month, I’d still probably favor Gatsby.js, but setting up a Gatsby project can feel kind of weighty with all of the React and GraphQL. Here, I was able to get up to speed in 10 minutes. If development time was an issue, (and I knew which plugins to use for deployment,) I could see myself considering Jekyll.

So, that was fun. #5 is going to be another non-trivial application. Here goes nothing.
